# gantz [![Actions Status](https://github.com/nannou-org/gantz/workflows/gantz/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nannou-org/gantz/actions) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/gantz.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/gantz) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/gantz.svg)](https://github.com/nannou-org/gantz/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT) [![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/gantz/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/gantz/)

A crate for creating and evaluating executable directed graphs at runtime. In
other words, gantz allows users to compose programs described by interconnected
nodes on the fly.

Gantz is inspired by a desire for a more flexible, high-performance, open-source
alternative to graphical programming environments such as Max/MSP, Touch
Designer, Houdini and others. <sup>Named after
[*gantz graf*](https://youtu.be/ev3vENli7wQ).</sup>

*NOTE: gantz is currently a research project and is not ready for any kind of
real-world use.*

## Design Overview

Gantz allows for constructing executable directed graphs by composing together
**Nodes**.

**Nodes** are a way to allow users to abstract and encapsulate logic into
smaller, re-usable components, similar to a function in a coded programming
language.

Every **Node** is made up of the following:

- Any number of inputs, where each input is of some rust type or generic type.
- Any number of outputs, where each output is of some rust type or generic type.
- An expression or function that takes the inputs as arguments and returns the
  outputs in a tuple.

**Graphs** describe the composition of one or more nodes. A graph may contain
one or more nested graphs represented as nodes, forming the main method of
abstraction within gantz.

A **Project** provides an API for easily creating graphs, compiling them into
Rust dynamic libraries and loading them ready for evaluation, all at runtime.
The project manages a single cargo workspace that contains a single crate for
each graph.

See the `gantz/tests` directory for some very basic, early proof-of-concept
tests.

## Included Crates

- **gantz_core** contains the core traits and items necessary for any gantz
  implementation. The current approach heavily revolves around rust-code
  generation, however this crate may get generalised in the future to allow for
  more easily targeting other languages.
- **gantz** provides implementations for the core traits and a high-level
  **Project** API for convenient use.

This repo does not provide any GUI itself - this will likely be implemented in a
separate repository using nannou.

## Goals

- [x] A simple function for creating nodes from rust expressions.
- [x] Allow for handling generics and trait objects within custom nodes.
- [x] `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for nodes and graphs via serde and typetag.
- [x] Project workspace creation.
- [x] **Push** evaluation through the graph.
- [x] **Pull** evaluation through the graph.
- [x] Simultaneous push and pull evaluation from multiple nodes.
- [x] Stateless node codegen.
- [x] Stateful node codegen.
- [x] Implement `Node` for `Graph`.
- [ ] Conditional evaluation #21.
- [ ] Evaluation boundaries #22.
- [ ] Dynamic node I/O configurations #31.
- [ ] A convenient API for managing node state #44.
- [ ] A way to easily generate node types from existing `fn`s in other crates.

After each of these goals are met, a new repository will be created where gantz
will be extended using [**nannou**](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou) to
provide higher-level tools including:

- [ ] A GUI for creating, editing and saving graphs and custom nodes at runtime.
- [ ] Node packaging and sharing tools, likely built on cargo and crates.io.
- [ ] A suite of nodes providing an interface to nannou's cross-platform support
  for a wide range of protocols and I/O:
  - [ ] Windowing and input events.
  - [ ] Phasers and signals.
  - [ ] Audio input, output, processing and device management.
  - [ ] 2D/3D geometry, graphics and shaders.
  - [ ] Video input and processing.
  - [ ] Networking (UDP and TCP).
  - [ ] OSC.
  - [ ] Lighting, lasers & control: DMX (via sACN), CITP (& CAEX), Ether-Dream.
  - [ ] GPU general compute.
  - [ ] General file reading and writing.
